# Bank Marketing Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer subscription behavior for a bank’s marketing campaigns using the UCI Bank Marketing dataset. The goal is to identify high-conversion customer segments and improve campaign effectiveness.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI
- DAX
- UCI Bank Marketing Dataset

## Key Metrics
- Total Customers
- Subscribed Customers
- Subscription Rate (%)
- Average Call Duration
- Average Campaign Contacts

## Key Insights
- Overall subscription rate is low (~11%), indicating inefficient mass targeting
- Students and retired customers show higher conversion rates
- Longer call durations are strongly associated with successful subscriptions
- Fewer, well-targeted campaign contacts perform better than repeated follow-ups

## Business Recommendations
- Focus marketing efforts on high-conversion segments (students, retired)
- Improve call quality instead of increasing call frequency
- Optimize campaign strategy to 1–3 contacts per customer
